# VROOM ðŸ›»
A Mars exploration game made with Three.JS + Flask.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the application's GitHub repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`git clone https://github.com/GSU-Web-Programming-2023/o-o-game.git`


This will create a folder named `vroom` in your current directory.

2. **Navigate to the project folder**

Change your current directory to the `vroom` folder:

`cd vroom`


3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

It is recommended to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate the dependencies. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

This will create a virtual environment named `env`. To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

- On Windows:

  ```
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:

  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

You should see `(env)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

4. **Install the required packages**

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of all the necessary packages for the web application. Install these packages using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the required packages, including Flask, Flask-Cors, Flask-Migrate, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and PyMySQL (if using MySQL), among others.

5. **Configure the environment variables**

If you decide to use something like MySQL it's highly advisable to store your credentials in environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```
DB_USERNAME=<your_database_username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
```

Replace `<your_database_username>`, `<your_database_password>`, `<your_database_host>`, and `<your_database_name>` with the appropriate values for your database.

6. **Initialize the database**

Before running the application, you need to set up and initialize the database. Run the following command:

`flask db init`

Next, apply the migrations with the following command:

`flask db migrate`

Finally, upgrade the database to the latest revision by running:

`flask db upgrade`

7. **Run the application**

You can now run the application using the following command:

`flask run`

This will start the web application on your local development server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment Script (NGINX + Systemd)

To deploy the application to a production server, you can use the following deployment script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remove the existing vroom directory
rm -rf vroom
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GSU-Web-Programming-2023/vroom
cd vroom
# Build the application
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# create the systemd service file
cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/vroom.service
[Unit]
Description=VROOM
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/opt/vroom
Environment="FLASK_APP=app"
Environment="FLASK_ENV=production"
ExecStart=/opt/vroom/env/bin/flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Create the Nginx configuration file
cat <<EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-available/vroom.conf
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ~^vroom\.judahpaul\.com$;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto \$scheme;
    }
}
EOF

sudo setenforce 0

ln -S /etc/nginx/sites-available/* /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*
nginx -t
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx --no-pager

# Start the application
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start vroom
systemctl enable vroom
systemctl status vroom --no-pager

echo "VROOM deployed successfully"
```

Save the script to a file named `setup_vroom.sh` (or whatever you want) and make it executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x setup_vroom.sh
```

You can then run the script to set up the application on the server:

```bash
./setup_vroom.sh
```
